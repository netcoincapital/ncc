# Introduction

Based on the mechanization and overscientificization of today's lives, we see the
destruction of many jobs by machines every day.
On the other hand, in order to meet our needs, we
will have to work several times a day. All the
next problems will be caused by these two
factors:

1- Becoming a machine

2- Full time work

It has infiltrated the lives of all human beings in
such a way that each human being has become a
human machine to regain his true position in
order to keep their job.

Netcoincapital is a startup that offers innovative
solutions to challenges in various fields such as
human capital, supply chain management, sales
and marketing, etc. to prevent countless losses in
this crisis.

Certainly, the strategy of this startup company
will be to create income and employment and
upgrade the scientific level in the fields of
finance and technology. When individual fintech startups work mostly in the field of mobile
and banks, it means that they have only helped 
the banks and the rich gets richer. But this startup
will pay enough attention to innovation and civic
responsibility in the field of FinTech, we will
work in the field of FinTech that will increase
revenue

# What is Netcoincapital?

Netcoincapital is a start-up in the field of fintech
and developer of artificial intelligence, which is
defined for operating in the blockchain platform.
Netcoincapital is an ideology based on two
pillars:

1- Job creation and income generation

2- Production of hardware and software
technology

We must first draw your attention to a revenuegenerating and knowledge-based system to
provide new technologies in the field of
blockchain, financial engineering and computer
science through your participation.

# Why Netcoincapital?

Netcoincapital builds an artificial intelligence
with the Python programming language. This
robot does not use leverage to analyze the
market, avoids unreasonable risks as much as
possible, and enters the market in appropriate
situations. Worked on the basis of digital
currencies, it has a good performance in capital
and risk management and accurately predicts the
market. One of the goals of this artificial
intelligence is to reach maturity in the financial
markets so that it can do things from Such as
analysis and introduction of new markets,
investment analysis and investment proposal,
offer the best position to enter the market and etc
to bring to the user.

Why Netcoincapital, because what will be built
here is a targeted financial system that seeks to
raise funds for the second season of Roadmap.
Thus we see that the two main pillars of this
startup work in parallel to advance the overall
goals of a single system. The first part of this
startup defines the goal, creates the market,
attracts capital and allocates the budget to other
vital organs, and the second part of this startup
has the task of research and development,
entering various branches of science, creating 
and building Technology is responsible for
preparing the final product and thus the steps
forward on the road map.

Also, one of the biggest parts of this project is its
educational part, which provides all members
and participants with all kinds of financial and
business training, and then will use its students
as a useful workforce in the system.

By presenting its token in the blockchain
platform, Netcoincapital intends to hold a new
way of ICO with the help of its robot, so that it
can take steps to operate its white paper and road
map by attracting capital from its members while
presenting its token in airdrop. Take it.
NetCoincapital has created a revenue-generating
opportunity for all members to monetize the
combination of blockchain and artificial
intelligence.

# robot
The first step in the roadmap is a trader robot that
is now ready and usable. The robot is written
using Python's high-level language based on
algorithmic trading and uses LSTM and ARMA
algorithms in time series topics that are from 
deep learning subfields that are actually related
to the structure of neural network and related
topics. With artificial intelligence. The robot
connects to Bainance through the API and
handles three main topics including risk
management, capital management and portfolio
management. For more information on how the
robot works, you can read the article presented in
the footer of the site in the How it works section.
