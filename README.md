# Introduction

Based on the mechanization and overscientificization of today's lives, we see the
destruction of many jobs by machines every day.
On the other hand, in order to meet our needs, we
will have to work several times a day. All the
next problems will be caused by these two
factors:

1- Becoming a machine

2- Full time work

It has infiltrated the lives of all human beings in
such a way that each human being has become a
human machine to regain his true position in
order to keep their job.

Netcoincapital is a startup that offers innovative
solutions to challenges in various fields such as
human capital, supply chain management, sales
and marketing, etc. to prevent countless losses in
this crisis.

Certainly, the strategy of this startup company
will be to create income and employment and
upgrade the scientific level in the fields of
finance and technology. When individual fintech startups work mostly in the field of mobile
and banks, it means that they have only helped 
the banks and the rich gets richer. But this startup
will pay enough attention to innovation and civic
responsibility in the field of FinTech, we will
work in the field of FinTech that will increase
revenue

# What is Netcoincapital?

Netcoincapital is a start-up in the field of fintech
and developer of artificial intelligence, which is
defined for operating in the blockchain platform.
Netcoincapital is an ideology based on two
pillars:

1- Job creation and income generation

2- Production of hardware and software
technology

We must first draw your attention to a revenuegenerating and knowledge-based system to
provide new technologies in the field of
blockchain, financial engineering and computer
science through your participation.

# Why Netcoincapital?

Netcoincapital builds an artificial intelligence
with the Python programming language. This
robot does not use leverage to analyze the
market, avoids unreasonable risks as much as
possible, and enters the market in appropriate
situations. Worked on the basis of digital
currencies, it has a good performance in capital
and risk management and accurately predicts the
market. One of the goals of this artificial
intelligence is to reach maturity in the financial
markets so that it can do things from Such as
analysis and introduction of new markets,
investment analysis and investment proposal,
offer the best position to enter the market and etc
to bring to the user.

Why Netcoincapital, because what will be built
here is a targeted financial system that seeks to
raise funds for the second season of Roadmap.
Thus we see that the two main pillars of this
startup work in parallel to advance the overall
goals of a single system. The first part of this
startup defines the goal, creates the market,
attracts capital and allocates the budget to other
vital organs, and the second part of this startup
has the task of research and development,
entering various branches of science, creating 
and building Technology is responsible for
preparing the final product and thus the steps
forward on the road map.

Also, one of the biggest parts of this project is its
educational part, which provides all members
and participants with all kinds of financial and
business training, and then will use its students
as a useful workforce in the system.

By presenting its token in the blockchain
platform, Netcoincapital intends to hold a new
way of ICO with the help of its robot, so that it
can take steps to operate its white paper and road
map by attracting capital from its members while
presenting its token in airdrop. Take it.
NetCoincapital has created a revenue-generating
opportunity for all members to monetize the
combination of blockchain and artificial
intelligence.

# robot
The first step in the roadmap is a trader robot that
is now ready and usable. The robot is written
using Python's high-level language based on
algorithmic trading and uses LSTM and ARMA
algorithms in time series topics that are from 
deep learning subfields that are actually related
to the structure of neural network and related
topics. With artificial intelligence. The robot
connects to Bainance through the API and
handles three main topics including risk
management, capital management and portfolio
management. For more information on how the
robot works, you can read the article presented in
the footer of the site in the How it works section.

# Execute token on Tron

The NCC token is offered on the Tron
blockchain platform. To use this token, the Tron
wallet is required. Also, the reasons that can be
used to use the Tron platform to provide this
digital currency are the low cost of network
transactions and high transaction speed are in
this platform.

Total available tokens: 102,000,000

Tokens available to manufacturers: 12,000,000

Tokens for AirDrop: 10,500,000

Tokens offered to the market: 79,500,000

# Start Defi system
This stage represents the official start of Defi
Startup activities, which includes the end of the
eleventh stage of Road Map. And includes a
complete cycle of decentralized economics

# Airdrop
AirDrop includes the initial offering of tokens to
initial investors for free. In the case of AirDrop,
people who have entered the initial stages of
start-up include receiving tokens for free. The
timeframe for AirDrop is eighteen to twenty-four
months after the start-up, which is approximately
equal to the start time of IEO.

# Exchange initial supply
After the completion of AirDrop and the increase
in the number of holders, the token will be ready
to be transferred to the exchange offices to find
its true value in the global market. Exchanges
will acquire its original value and will be
registered in the coinmarketcap.

# Silk payment gateway
After inserting the token in coinmarketcap, the
first financial project, is creating an online
payment gateway on the blockchain platform,
will start. In this project, the goal is to create a
platform for payment with all coins and tokens
on the market. Users can pay in different
currencies online.

# Lending
The lending system works like any other similar
system, digital currency holders can lend any
valid digital currency to this startup in exchange
for a monthly interest, the startup can use the lent
capital in the financial markets and with the
amount of capital raised, it strives to be
profitable, and the profits will be shared among
the lenders.

# Decentralized wallet
The next project presented in the roadmap is to
create a decentralized wallet on the blockchain
platform. This will ensure that the assets of the 
participants in this startup as a value in a secure
platform are well maintained. On the other hand,
this decentralized wallet is a good platform to
provide decentralized exchange to
manufacturers.

# Decentralized exchange
Decentralized exchange will be created in the
context of the above-mentioned wallet.
Decentralized exchange will allow users to
convert their digital assets into Fiat currency
without intermediaries and heavy fees, and vice
versa.

# credit card
Credit cards, which can be considered as
hardware wallets, allow you to store your digital
assets. These cards are attached to your digital
wallet and in some places Who accept digital
currency will be usable.

# Cloud Mining
In the last stage of the first season of the
roadmap, there is cloud mining. In this section,
using the strategy of locking assets for a limited
time, the goal is to increase the value of the
token, in this way, which does not require strong
hardware. It can be rewarded by locking its
assets from ongoing transactions, in simpler
terms it will be rewarded by increasing the power
of the network.

# Monetization model
By renting a robot, Netcoincapital allows people
to pay 2.5 to 7% interest and pays a commission
in the form of affiliate marketing. They can
increase their shares and get more tokens with
the help of income plan.

In this project, participants will receive
commissions from the first, second and third
levels

First level 5%

Second level 2%

Third level 3%

(In case of increase in the shopping cart, the
representative will receive 5% commission)

If the amount brought from the total of three
levels during a month is one thousand dollars and
above one thousand dollars, 5% double
commission will be paid

It should be noted that in the AirDrop program,
participants receive commissions from all three
levels

First level 20%

Second level 10%

Third level 20%

# Next chapter
After successfully completing the first chapter,
the second chapter of the roadmap will start. The
second chapter of the roadmap will be presented
fully in the next White Paper update.
